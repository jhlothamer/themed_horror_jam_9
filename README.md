This game was created for the [Themed Horror Game Jam #9](https://itch.io/jam/themed-horror-game-jam-9). For the jam we had a choice between themes and chose the Witching Hour theme. We also implemented two bonus challenges: witchcraft and familiar.

The game can be downloaded from itch.io at [https://jlothamer.itch.io/witching-hour](https://jlothamer.itch.io/witching-hour).

## Gameplay

The game is loosely inspired by Five Nights at Freddie's. Instead of simply warding off enemies with the camera mechanic, the goal of the game is to complete the witch's brew by having one of the characters attend the cauldron till the brew is complete. Once the brew is finished, it vaporizes and spreads out into the world, ending the attack from zombie horde and thus winning the game.

Zombies come in waves and are either low, medium or high aggression. Low aggression zombies shamble about the cabin. Medium aggression zombies attack a window or door a few times and then convert to low aggression. High aggression zombies attack relentlessly, breaking down doors or windows, and go for the nearest character. Zombies that are simply wandering outside the cabin (low aggression) will trigger into high aggression when they get close to a broken door or window. So, the player may have a cabin full of a zombies to deal with very quickly.

Not all characters can interact with all stations. (A station is an interact-able thing - like the cauldron, mana pool, doors and windows, wood pile, crystal ball and spellbook.) By default the goblin minions can collect wood from the wood pile in order to effect repairs to doors and windows. They can also tend the potion brewing in the cauldron and do a melee attack. The witch can interact with the cauldron, mana pool, crystal ball and spellbook. When the spellbook is activated, this gives the minions the ability to collect mana from the mana pool and increases the rate they stir the cauldron and repair windows and doors. When a character has enough mana, they can shoot zombies with a magic missile. The crystal ball can only ever be used by the witch. This is used to see outside the cabin as well as cast a ward in one of the view directions that will cause up to 5 zombies to retreat.
